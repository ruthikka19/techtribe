This project runs a small Flask app to track income, expenses, budgets and savings goals.
Students living away from home often struggle with budget management. Build a simple expense tracking app that helps students log expenses and stick to monthly budgets.

Solution:
We have designed a completely prepared website which saves and updates all expenses according to the category needed along with other additional features for example, saving goals searching for particular spends and budget aims.
A website which can store and update your saving is what we designed.

Tech Stack: 
1. Frontend: HTML, CSS
2. Backend: Python, Flask
3. Database: SQLite
4. Visuals: tables.js
5. AI integration: Use for sample data, code optimization and advanced codes

To run the website:
Paste the link provided and access the website using the buttons available in any browser of your choice.

Quick start (Windows, using provided venv):

1. Activate the virtualenv (if you use the included `.venv`):

```powershell
C:/Users/MaanuRuthi/OneDrive/Desktop/techtribe/.venv/Scripts/Activate.ps1
```

2. Install dependencies (if needed):

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the app:

```powershell
C:/Users/MaanuRuthi/OneDrive/Desktop/techtribe/.venv/Scripts/python.exe app.py
```

4. Open in your browser:

- Home: http://127.0.0.1:5000/home
- Dashboard: http://127.0.0.1:5000/

Editing templates:

- Templates are in the `templates/` folder. With the server running in debug mode, changes to templates should auto-reload.
- If you make changes and they don't appear, stop the server and restart.

Theme toggle:

- A floating theme button (top-right) toggles light/dark and persists to `localStorage`.

Learning: 
Data consistency implementing CRUD operations
Time management 
Different applications used for creating the website 
Use of different programming languages 

Challenges:
Advanced knowledge of coding required 
Commiting the changes and modifying it
